# Portfolio

This portfolio was created with 1-2 weeks of knowledge HTML and CSS, it uses flexbox and bootstrap as it's core foundation. I wanted the portfolio to be simple and minimalistic, it was built with the intentions to meet the google material guideline and easy navigation of projects I have done. 

## Ideation

My original idea was to create an animation based portfolio inspired by http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/ which involves an interactive portfolio. However, as I was building my website I came across a lot of obstacles due to my lack of understanding of javascript. Fortunately this birthed a new challenge to test my creativity skills using the foundations of html and css.

I wanted a design which was simple, intuitive and easy for the eyes. With the consumer's mindset in mind, I needed a portfolio in which people could scroll through my work instantly without reading through content which explains about my whole lifestory. I wanted it to be majority graphic based. 

I drew inspirations from sites such as:
* behance
* dribble
* awwward
* google material blogs

## Problems I encountered

The problems I encountered were the following:
* Design Mind Block
* Trouble understanding some aspects of how bootstrap worked
* Lack of Javascript understanding
* Ways to implement ruby into my portfolio
* Understanding of how all the elements worked together with CSS
* Creating an uncluttred interface
* Branding - a cohesive colour scheme
* Making it responsive 

Upon reflection, if I were to improve this portfolio I would work on the following:

* Clear design process
* Consider a design which is adaptable for both monitor, tablets and smartphones
